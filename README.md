## Features
- Node based dialogue files, each node containing information like speaker, body text, destinations, events, and flags to be set, saved, or checked.

- A visual file writer, allowing for ease of use for writers

## In Development
- A rapid file tester packaged with the file writer, allowing for writers to test their files immediately.

## Future Plans
- Sample implementations for the dialogue system, including an RPG-inspired reader, a faux messaging app, a Metal Gear-inspired codec reader, and a cinematic reader
- Documentation to allow programmers and writers to use the system to its fullest potential

# Notes

An open source, node-based customizable dialogue system for the Unity Engine.

## Features
- Node based dialogue files, each node containing information like speaker, body text, destinations, events, and flags to be set, saved, or checked.
- A visual file writer, allowing for ease of use for writers
- A base dialogue reader to be implemented and customized for your games

## Future Plans
- Implementation of a new system using JSON files rather than TXT files, allowing for greater customization of the dialogue system and its nodes
- Sample implementations for the dialogue system, including an RPG-inspired reader, a faux messaging app, a Metal Gear-inspired codec reader, and a cinematic reader
- Integration of the file writer into the Unity Engine, so writers can write and test files in the same place
- Documentation to allow programmers and writers to use the system to its fullest potential
